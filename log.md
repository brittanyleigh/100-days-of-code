### Day 6: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning React on Treehouse & Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Got about 3/4 of the way through the Treehouse React tutorial and started feeling lost, so I switched to Codecademy for a little handholding. I forget how helpful it can be to learn from multiple sources.

### Day 15: April 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading YDKJS & played with styling of my baseball app

**Thoughts:** I think I want to continue a routine of reading/learning so that I can improve my current skills and learn new ones, while at the same time building little projects using the skills I already know
